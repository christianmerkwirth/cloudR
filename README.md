# CloudR - Scripts and Info for working with R in the Cloud 

## Overview

R is an increasingly popular, powerful and versatile platform for data science. R started as a standalone
application limited to the resources available on single machine. But even a modern powerful machine does not
always provide enough CPU and memory for the today's big data challenges.

Luckily, there is a number of cloud platform that provide virtually unlimited compute and storage resources. We
focus here on three providers:

* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* Amazon AWS
* Microsoft Azure

However, working with R in the Cloud is not always trivial for several reasons:

* Account and technical setup on the user side.
* Deciding which kind of parallelization approach is needed for the given task.
* Implementation and task orchestration.

In the last few years fortunately many R packages have been written that drastically lower
the barrier of connecting R to the cloud.

Still, in most cases there are several viable approaches, which can differ in terms of complexity, robustness
and costs. At the time of writing this there is not very concise information about the various
possibilities. This repo tries to bring some light into this jungle by providing examples and
infos how to work R with the Cloud.
